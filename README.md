> This site aims to provide a simple tool to track global progress in defeating Covid-19
> All data is pulled from the COVID-19 data repository provided by Johns Hopkins University. Which in turn pulls data from various government sources, and tracking projects such as Workpointnews. All code for this site is open source. It is built with ReactJS and consumes the Johns Hopkins data via a axios which in turn wraps a another parser.
